Since 2006, I have been working on the <a href="https://indexmod.gq/indexmod-blockchainpedia">concept</a> of Indexmod and invite you to jointly edit short articles on fashion and art, or to become the <a href="https://indexmod.gq/indexmod-curators">curator</a> of one of the world's capitals.

Every tiny change to any page is recorded and stored on the cloud blockchain on the network.

Here are articles about new brands and young artists. <a href="https://indexmod.gq/edit">Edit</a> existing pages, or <a href="mailto:indexmod@ya.ru">propose to create</a> new articles. Indexmod has two main differences: a clean layout and a conceptually new approach to data visualization in the form of the <a href="https://indexmod.gq/universe">Indexmod universe</a>.</p>
